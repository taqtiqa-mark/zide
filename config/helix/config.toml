# Version: 15.1
#
# Helix Key Remapping Template (based on v15.1 defaults)
# All default bindings are commented with succinct descriptions.
# Live settings are set to "no_op" to disable them.
# Markings:
# (**LSP**): Requires active language server(s)
# (**TS**): Requires tree-sitter grammar
# (NOT REMAPPABLE): Binding does not support remapping (not included here if non-remappable)
# Note: Picker, Prompt, Popup, Completion Menu, and Signature-help Popup are NOT REMAPPABLE and thus not included.
# Use this as a template: uncomment and modify as needed.
# TUI Limitations: No GUI elements like ribbons or print previews; emulations approximate behaviors modally.
# All documents assumed Markdown; formatting mapped to MD equivalents.
