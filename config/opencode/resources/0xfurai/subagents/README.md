## Installation

These subagents are automatically available when placed in `~/.claude/agents/` directory.

```bash
cd ~/.claude
git clone https://github.com/0xfurai/claude-code-subagents.git
```

## Usage

### Automatic Invocation
Claude Code will automatically delegate to the appropriate subagent based on the task context and the subagent's description.

### Explicit Invocation
Mention the subagent by name in your request:
```
"Use the python-expert to optimize this algorithm"
"Get the react-expert to refactor this component"
```

## Contributing

To add a new subagent:
1. Create a new `.md` file in the `agents/` directory
2. Use lowercase, hyphen-separated names
3. Write clear descriptions for when the subagent should be used
4. Include specific instructions in the system prompt
5. Follow the established format with focus areas, approach, quality checklist, and output
