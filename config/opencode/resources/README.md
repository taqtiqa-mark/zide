# Resources: Agents, Commands and Skills

A collection of 3rd-party templates and agents, commands, skills and scripts.

Open this as a project and we use the initial `skills/skill-creator.md` and the guides to collate and refactor these 3rd-party artifacts into a coherent set of Agents, Commands and Skills that can be adapted in the ZIDE OpenCode.
