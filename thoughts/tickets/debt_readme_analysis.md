## Description
Analyze the existing README.md file for structure, content, and clarity. Recommend and implement improvements based on adopted best practices, including sections for installation instructions, usage examples, contribution guidelines, visuals, troubleshooting, security considerations, code examples, SEO/multilingual support, documentation integrations, and community building.

## Context
The README is a critical entry point for users and contributors. This ticket addresses technical debt in documentation to improve project accessibility, usability, and engagement. Based on user input, core improvements are in scope, while advanced features like accessibility, licensing, analytics, changelogs, CI/CD badges, related projects, and performance benchmarks are out of scope.

## Requirements

### Functional Requirements
- Evaluate and enhance structure, content, and clarity
- Add or improve installation and usage sections
- Include contribution guidelines
- Incorporate visuals, troubleshooting, security info, examples, SEO/multilingual support, docs integrations, and community sections

### Non-Functional Requirements

- Follow open-source documentation best practices
- Maintain concise and relevant content

## Current State
Existing README.md exists but may lack comprehensive sections and best practices.

## Desired State
An improved README.md that incorporates all adopted best practices, making the project more approachable and maintainable.
